Coap - coap-listener.php
Would be nice if it can be a native server, would save space an performance
like https://github.com/obgm/libcoap-minimal/blob/main/server.cc

For now we used composer require ekongyun/php-coap (https://github.com/cfullelove/PhpCoap)
Which pulls in react/react: 0.4.*
https://github.com/reactphp/reactphp/tree/v0.4.1

.git/tests/examples where removed in the vendor directory to save space.
